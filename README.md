# Matrixtranspose

Code example in Java language that finds the transpose of matrix constructed with multidimensional arrays.

To transpose the matrix means to swap the same numbered rows and columns of the matrix. The matrix obtained as a result of this operation is the transpose of the original matrix. At this stage, the transpose (transpose) of a kxn matrix becomes an nxk matrix. For example, suppose we have a matrix A. The transpose of this matrix A is denoted by A^T (A to T).

For example, the transpose of the 2x3 matrix A below is a 2x3 matrix A^T.
